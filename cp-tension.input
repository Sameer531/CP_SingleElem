c     A very simple WARP3D example.
c     Single element, loading set up for uniaxial tension and simple shear. 
c
c     Model is a single linear hexagonal element of length 1x1x1.  Faces
c     on the xy, xz, and yz planes have symmetry constraints.  Other faces
c     have tractions appropriate for the load choice
c
c     Material model is now single crystal plasticity.
c
c     All the load are applied in 100 equal steps, output to screen and
c     to paraview for plotting.
c
c     Units for the mesh are MPa and mm.

c     on individual nodes.

c     The commands of the form:
c           compute displacements for loading x step y
c     tell warp3d to impose y steps of loading x on the model
c     This command actually triggers solving the load steps
c
c     The other commands are for output
c           output displacements 5-8
c     tell warp3d to print the displacements for nodes 5, 6, 7, 8
c           output stresses 1
c           output strains 1
c     tell warp3d to print the stresses/strains for element 1
c     
c     The reminder of the output commands are patran specific
c           output patran neutral file 'fromwarp.out'
c     tells warp3d to output a patran compatible neutral file of the mesh
c           output patran binary displacements
c     produces a patran compatible results file with the nodal displacements
c     Notice we do this before imposing any load so we have the
c     undeformed mesh at load step "0".
c           output patran binary element stresses
c           output patran binary element strains
c     outputs a patran compatible file for the stresses/strains at the element
